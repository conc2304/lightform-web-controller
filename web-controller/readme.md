# Lightform Web Controller App

This is Lightform's web controller app built with StencilJs and the Ionic framework. The goal of this app is to create a place where users can control their Oak experience through selecting different scenes, controlling device playback, creating new scene and alignments for objects as well as environments, and to help them through the device registration process.

## Getting Started
All of the following commands are expected to be run from this directory: `.web/web-controller`

Installing dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server and launch the application

```bash
npm start
```

### Building for Production (uses prod api)
```bash
npm run build
```

### Use this build for beta / dev build
For an internal runtime in an IoT device with Android Webview (AKA: LF2+, Oak ...)
(uses dev api)
```bash 
npm run build.dev
```

To run the unit tests once, run:

```
npm test
```

To run the unit tests and watch for file changes during development, run:

```
npm run test.watch
```

## Source Directory Layout

* _package.json_   - Node package files installed with `npm install`.
* _stencil.config.ts_   - Stencil Configuration file (config docs)[https://stenciljs.com/docs/config]
* _tsconfig.json_   - Typescript project config specifies the root files and the compiler options required to compile the project. 
* **/src**          - All of the component source files for the component library.
    * _components.d.ts_      - Public type declarations automatically generated by Stencil for components
    * _index.html_           - Public html file served 
    * _dist.html_            - Public html file used for intern distribution build that inlines all dependencies
    * _index.ts_             - Entry file for project that exports component declarations from _components.d.ts_
    * _decs.d.ts_            - Type declaration file

* **/global**      - Common or globally used component files like SCSS files, and configs

        * **/shared**       - Components shared across the app
        * **/app-root**     - Root web component
        * **/pages**        - Bundles of components that correspond to router urls
* **/shared**        - Shared component utilities 
        * **/constants**    - ES6 importable constants

## Discussion

Technologies used: JSX, SCSS, StencilJs (with Typescript and Class-Style Components), 

I used Stencils ionic-pwa as the starter config to generate the scaffolding for this app.

Dependencies Added/Used:

- [StencilJs](https://stenciljs.com/) (Toolchain for building web components)
- [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) (UI toolkit/library for basic components)
- [p5JS](https://p5js.or) (Processing Library for WebGl Interaction used in the scene setup and alignment flow)
- [iso8601-duration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iso8601-duration) (Library for handling and converting ISO dates and durations)
- [js-logger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-logger) (Library for better logging)
